Sadly, fame can be a very cruel bedfellow for the unwary
Strauss-Kahn cannot run IMF: US	slice The International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is facing growing pressure to quit after US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the disgraced head was "not in a position to run" the international financial institution. John Lipsky, second-in-command at the IMF, has taken over as acting chief, but Geithner called on the IMF's executive board to designate an interim head as Lipsky is due to leave the fund later this year. He said the most important thing for the IMF was that it found a leader to fill Strauss-Kahn's shoes after his arrest over an alleged sexual assault on a New York hotel maid Sunday. "He (Strauss-Kahn) is obviously not in a position to run the IMF and it is important that the board of the IMF formally put in place for an interim period someone to act as managing director," Geithner said addressing the Harvard Club in New York Tuesday. However, Geithner refused to comment on the case or the details of the charges against Strauss-Kahn. White House press secretary also declined comment on the case, but maintained "We retain full confidence in the IMF and its continued capacity to fulfill its obligations, to fulfill its role in the global economy during this difficult period." While he would not "talk about the process for selecting potentially a future head of the IMF," Carney said: "I think the important point is that we believe that the IMF can and will continue to function and fulfill its role in the global economy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry also stopped short of calling for Strauss-Kahn's resignation, but he called the circumstances of the case "troubling if not damning." "If the evidence is what it appears to be, I think it would be very difficult for him to manage" as IMF head, Kerry said. It is the first time top US officials have publicly spoken about the impact of Strauss-Kahn's alleged sexual assault. Washington has a major say in determining who runs the IMF, because it has the largest number of votes in the organisation. Meanwhile, an IMF spokesman said that diplomatic immunity would not cover its managing director in this case. "We have not had contact with the managing director since his arrest in New York," he said.

Strauss-Kahn DNA Reportedly Found On Hotel Maid’s Clothes Forensic evidence would confirm that a sexual act occurred between DSK and his accuser. By Josh Voorhees | Posted Tuesday, May. 24, 2011, at 8:58 AM EDT Tweet A DNA sample taken from former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn reportedly matches semen found on the work clothes of the hotel maid accusing him of sexual assault. The forensic evidence was first reported Monday by the French website Atlantico.fr, and later confirmed by a number of U.S. media outlets, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal . (The Times cites “a person briefed on the matter” as it source; the Journal spoke with unnamed “law enforcement officials.”) The Times : The results … represented the first forensic evidence confirming that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, had indeed engaged in a sexual act with the housekeeper, a 32-year-old woman from Guinea who was granted asylum in the United States and is raising her 15-year-old daughter. The DNA match supports the account provided by the woman to police, but would also appear to be consistent with what Strauss-Kahn’s legal team has suggested may be his defense: that a sexual encounter did in fact occur when the woman came to clean his room but that it was consensual. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have declined to comment on the reports. Other test results, including from samples taken from the hotel suite’s carpet, are still pending.

‘Nice a**’ – Strauss-Kahn`s last words to air hostess moments before arrest
(IRN)-U.S. Senator Mark S. Kirk (R-Ill.) says Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, must go. Kirk said on the Senate floor that Strauss-Kahn must be replaced in light of charges that he sexually assaulted a maid in his New York hotel suite. "Mr. Strauss-Kahn has forfeited our confidence and should resign or be fired at the IMF," Kirk said. The Times, a British newspaper, reported that Strauss-Kahn's reputation in France for pursuing women aggressively was such that French President Nicolas Sarkozy personally warned him to control himself when he departed for the United States to head the IMF. Kirk used his floor speech to criticize the IMF's handling of the European debt crisis, arguing that American taxpayers should not be contributing to bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. "The institution's role in the global financial system requires strong leadership," Kirk said, adding that the IMF deputy managing director should take over. Kirk said he encouraged U.S. officials to strongly press for Strauss-Kahn's removal. Strauss-Kahn has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers have said he will argue that the sex was consensual.

Chancellor George Osborne described Ms Lagarde as the "outstanding candidate" to take over the helm of the world financial body. His endorsement will seal her status as the overwhelming favourite in the race to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who quit to fight charges of attempted rape in New York. It follows similar backing from German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who said she is "outstandingly qualified" for the post. In a statement, Mr Osborne said: "On the basis of merit, I believe Christine is the outstanding candidate for the IMF - and that's why Britain will back her. "She's shown real international leadership as chair of the G20 finance ministers this year. She has also been a strong advocate for countries tackling high budget deficits and living within their means. "We support her because she's the best person for the job, but I also personally think it would be a very good thing to see the first female managing director of the IMF in its 60 year history." There is speculation that her appointment could be confirmed as early as next week at the G8 summit in the French resort of Deauville. The move has however angered some in the developing world who want to break with tradition and see a non-European installed in the post - reflecting the growing importance of the emerging economies.
